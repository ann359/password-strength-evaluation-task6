## Passwords Tested and Results

| Password                    | Strength   | Crack Time Estimate      | Notes                                      |
|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|  apple123                   |Very Weak   |    0.09 seconds          | Too common and predictable                 |
| BlueSky2025!                | Medium     |    4 hours               | Better, but still guessable                |
| `MangoesAreYummy99!!`       |Very Strong | Billions of years        | Passphrase style, excellent complexity     |
| `L$2wV8@rBn!`               |Very Strong | 160 trillion years       | Random and complex                         |
| CyberW@rrior_LearnsFast99   |Very Strong | 92 million years         | Personal + complex with good entropy       |

## What I Learned

- Password **length** is more important than just complexity.
- **Passphrases** (long, memorable phrases) are both secure and easy to remember.
- Avoid common passwords and dictionary words.
- Mixing **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols** improves strength.
- Using a **password manager** helps store and create strong passwords securely.

##  Common Password Attacks

1. **Brute Force** – Tries all combinations. Longer passwords resist this better.
2. **Dictionary Attack** – Uses known words. Avoid real words or names.
3. **Credential Stuffing** – Uses leaked credentials from other sites.
4. **Phishing** – Tricks users into giving passwords away.

##  Best Practices for Password Security

- Use at least **12–16 characters**
- Include **all character types**
- Avoid **predictable patterns** (like `123`, `qwerty`)
- Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** when available
- Don’t reuse passwords across accounts

| `screenshots/`      | Folder with screenshots from strength tests|

##  Conclusion

This task helped me understand how to create strong, unique passwords and recognize common attack types. I now feel confident in evaluating password strength and avoiding weak practices.
